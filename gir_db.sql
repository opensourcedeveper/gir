Because the aerospace and defence industries have a longer lifespan, companies are forced to keep large inventories. Variable market dynamics, on the other hand, pose significant challenges for these players, as high stocks make them incapable of responding quickly to market changes. The aerospace and defence industries are heavily reliant on macroeconomic factors and are primarily governed by government agencies. It is divided into five key segments: commercial and military aircraft, space systems, ground defence, and shipbuilding. The industry is experiencing moderate growth, which is primarily hampered by a large number of sole-source suppliers, long lead times, financial constraints, order backlogs leading to extensive inventories, and cyber threats. Furthermore, certain factors such as current lending rates and low demand for aftermarket services are expected to have a negative impact on the sector, beginning with the supply chain of tier 2 and 3 companies. Our team has distinguished itself in the market as a strategic team that is solely focused on the Aerospace and Defense industry and has a unique understanding of market opportunities and constraints.

Auto dealers have been unable to deliver vehicles during the lockdown period, and have reported 30-45 days of finished goods inventory, which will most likely be heavily discounted after the lockdown. When COVID hit, robo-taxis and ridesharing technologies suffered as well. Prior to the pandemic, many companies were investing in ridesharing and robo-taxi capabilities, with the shared economy seen as the future. Increased investment in electrification was one of COVID&#39;s most notable outcomes. Ford has promised a full battery-electric vehicle (BEV) line-up in Europe by 2030; GM has committed to discontinuing production of the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) by 2035; and Jaguar and Volvo have stated that all of their vehicles will be electric-powered by 2030. Nationwide lockdowns have had a significant impact on the automotive industry, particularly in Western economies, particularly in Europe, which are critical automotive manufacturing hubs.

The Construction and Manufacturing Sector caters to two major markets:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Manufacturing is the fabrication and processing of mechanical, physical, or chemical substances, materials, or components from raw materials and commodities into newer products.</li>\r\n	<li>Construction is a broad term that refers to the work done in the construction of buildings or other engineering projects, such as highways and utility systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandemic of COVID-19 has resulted in a severe labor shortage in the construction industry. During the economic downturn, the industry shed over 2 million jobs. The majority of workers in the sector are contract workers, and global lockdowns caused many of them to lose their jobs, resulting in a mass migration of contract workers to their home towns/cities. These workers are now employed in other industries, and the construction industry is experiencing a labor shortage of semi-skilled and skilled workers. The construction industry has always been challenged by the high volatility of raw material prices. Material costs, for example, increased by 5.3 percent between 2017 and 2018. Extreme variations have raised concerns about the industry&#39;s overall performance. The table below depicts the price index of a few key raw materials used in the construction industry.</p>\r\n',	'<p>HighwayGuard LDS, a MASH 16 TL-3 compliant steel safety barrier, was introduced by Valmont Industries, Inc. in December 2019.

Germany, for example, is likely to feel the effects of the Covid-19 crisis more acutely than the global economy as a whole. According to the German government&#39;s spring forecast, Germany&#39;s economy will contract by 6.3 percent in real terms in 2020, representing a 6.9 percentage point drop from the 2019 growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, demand for residential construction remains strong, and financial assistance from the public sector could ease the burden on low-income households; however, this could also include a rent cap, which would reduce profit margins in residential real estate. The commercial sector is expected to be the hardest hit, with a 6% drop in real terms expected in 2020 due to revenue collapse, with some firms reporting zero sales during the lockdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Short and Middle term impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to contain the spread of the coronavirus may result in an increase in domestic building materials supplies due to suppliers&#39; inability to export to desired locations. At the same time, imports will face similar challenges, resulting in an unpredictable mix of price fluctuations. However, due to supply chain bottlenecks, building material prices may rise in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Long Term Impact and strategies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction companies must identify and prioritize critical building materials.

International borders have been sealed, and several economies have declared partial or total lockdowns, effectively halting trade activity. Protectionist policies are already being implemented in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, upsetting the global trade balance. Even before the pandemic hit the global economy, the automotive industry was in disarray. Automobile sales and production were down due to lower consumer spending, and passenger vehicle demand was low. However, the demand for commercial vehicles increased marginally. This trend is likely to continue for some time after the pandemic has been contained. Demand for consumer goods and other products has decreased as a result of the pandemic. As a result, manufacturing industries have reduced their output. Furthermore, manufacturing activities are hampered by a lack of labor as workers return to their home countries, and their return is uncertain.
